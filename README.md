# Wine Quality Data Analysis Project

## Motivation
I started this project so I could become more familiar with using the pandas and numpy libraries. These Python libraries are widely used for data science projects. I chose the Red Wine Quality dataset because it is a popular dataset for those new to data science and it would be fun to learn about what factors influence wine taste and quality! 

## Project Files
1. Wine Quality Exploration.ipynb: This is the Jupyter Notebook file I use to document my analysis of the dataset and provide the relevant Python code. I chose Jupyter Notebook because it would allow me to write up an analysis of the dataset and provide any code I used to create the figures and visualizations. To view and edit this file, you'll need to install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install). To run this file, navigate to the folder with the Jupyter Notebook file and use the commmand 'jupyter notebook'. 
2. wine-quality-analysis.py: To just view the code used in this project, I have provided a Python file that generates the same analysis as the Jupyter Noteobok file. You will need Python 3 installed in order to be able to run this file. 
3. winequality-red.csv: This is the copy of the dataset that I used. For more information about the dataset, you can read the introduction in my Wine Quality Exploration notebook.
